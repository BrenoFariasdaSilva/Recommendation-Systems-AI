## HTTP Access Methods<a name="http-access-methods"></a>

Learn about HTTP access methods, including inclusion (POST), selection (GET), update (PUT/PATCH), and exclusion (DELETE). These methods are fundamental for interacting with web services.

## Working with REST API<a name="working-with-rest-api"></a>

Explore how to work with REST APIs, including understanding REST API documentation, making HTTP requests, and processing JSON data.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous Consumption<a name="synchronous-and-asynchronous-consumption"></a>

Understand the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous consumption of services, enabling your recommendation systems to efficiently manage and process external data.

## Introduction to Service Types<a name="service-types"></a>

Get an introduction to different service types, including gRPC for high-performance APIs and GraphQL for flexible data querying.

Feel free to dive into each topic according to your needs and pace. This module will equip you with essential skills for consuming services with APIs and integrating external data into your recommendation system projects.

Happy API consumption! üöÄüåê
